# Contribution GuideLines
**Thank you** for considering contribution to this project.  
I belive this project is a good concept, and really can change the way we authenticate with services!  
## Method of contibution
There are 2 main ways to contribute:  
### Forking (1)
So if you have a plan, and you want to do things you can:
1. Fork the project and make your changes  
2. Issue a pull request and get your changes reviewed
3. Your changes get pulled into the project!

It's simple as this, the review is important, but don't be shy to contibute because of it. This is just to make sure that the project is working together with your changes.  

### Creating issues (2)
Even if it's just a question, a suggestion open a new issue about it.  
Thanks to the labels github provides, I can differentiate between bugs and questions/suggestions!  
When opening an issue please check out other open issues, maybe your question has been posted before!  
If you do write a new issue, please be sure that:
1. I can understand what you wrote (I can read english and that's it)
2. You provide enough information when posting about a problem/possible bug
3. You provide enough details about a new feature when posting a suggestion

Just keep in mind these **3 points** and contributing will be a better experience for everybody!

## Type and Priority of contribution
### Label Priority
* Bugs and Fixes are the \#1 Priority for me
* Resource usage is the next priority in the list
* Questions come next, however I may answer an easy question before fixing a bug
* Suggestions/New features are the last, because I want to make sure the program works before putting more on top of it!
### Type priority
* Security issues are \#1, because this project is working with credentials
* General bugs
* Optimization code
* User experience
* User interface
### Types of required contributions
This paragraph is subject to change as time goes on.
* Security People, as I wrote I need to make sure the security of this application is as strong as it can be.  
  * Ask any security related questions, and I'll be more than happy to answer them.  
  * Make a suggestion, I'm open to reworking the current code, if it can get more secure by doing so.  
  * It's optional but please provide an example on how to re-create a potential security vulnerability.
* C\#/.NET Developers, because **100%** of the code is written in C\#  
  * You can give anything from security fixes, to code optimization.  
  * I'm also happy if you can point out some edge-cases I didn't notice
  * .NET is changing constantly so new language features could be implemented by this group
* People knowing >1 languages, because I think this is a good project for everyone to use.
  * You have to translate the messages the user actually sees from the output. This doesn't include debugging messages written to console.
  * I belive this project can get big so I want to support more languages than just english.
  * Also if you know how C\# Applications can support multiple languages, then open an issue ASAP! (I can do it manually if that's the only option)
* User experience people, because I want this to be beautiful to look at and easy to use  
  * Point out design issues, think of how people can use this easier.
  * This group needs work together with the language group in case of RTL languages
* User Interface Designers, because I want this project to look good!  
  * This goes close with the UX people, but that group is more of the thinker side of the things I think.  
  * In this group you can take suggestions from the UX group and **implement** them in the code.  
  * If you have a logo design open an issue ASAP!
  * Current State of UI is crap, everything you submit is better than *that*
* Testers, because we need to make sure the app actually works  
  * This is the last group, here you need to test the application, from A-Z.  
  * Think of edge cases and try them out.  
  * If an error message if ugly you can work with the UX and UI groups.
  * If an edge case isn't handled properly you can work with the C\#/.NET Dev group
* Windows 10 People/People with experience with Windows Store
  * This is really far future, the app has to grow really quick to come to this point
  * I'm not a huge Win10 guy, I use Win7 until it stops receiving updates or until my next PC upgrade
  * But supporting Win10 and Store would be key in the future, because of Win10 S mode and stuff
  * Just keep in mind that this project may need support with this kind of stuff later
  
If you didn't fall in any of the categories, then don't worry. These are just guidelines, about what the project requires. Maybe I forgot a topic?  
Ignore this list then and go for opening an issue! Remember that all of the issues are welcome!
